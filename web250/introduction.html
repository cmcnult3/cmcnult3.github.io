		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  Grew up the child of an army soldier, moving just about every 3 years of childhood. However, 
		  I finished highschool & my first college degree in NC and moved back here in 2018, So I guess NC is starting to feel like 
		  home. I am married and have 2 young boys aged 9 and 5. I also have 2 dogs, a chow/ shepard mix and a labradoodle.</li>
		  <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> After graduating with my parks & rec degree from WCU I spent a couple years working in 
		  camps and nonprofits leading outdoor adventures (whitewater rafting, skiing, guided hikes, etc.) and teaching environmental 
		  science clinics. After tiring from living on the road and turning my hobbies into work I decided to make a career change. 
		  There were a couple of odd jobs in between but I have now established a career as an engineering technician for a petroleum pipeline company.</li>
		  <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  I received a B.S. in Parks & Recreation management from Western Carolina in 2010. After establishing a career pretty far 
		  off from that subject matter I decided to enroll in the database development program at CPCC in 2020. If all goes well, I’ll graduate at the end of this semester</li>
		  <li><strong>Background in This Subject:</strong> Part of my current career involves interaction with large sets of pipeline assessment data that drive maintenance and remediation activities 
		  for the pipeline. Interaction with those data sets is ultimately what piqued my interest in data science and led to my enrollment in this program. 
		  Hoping this experience will help me to more efficiently use our database programs to analyze, report on, and communicate assessment results and requirements for 
		  maintenance activities.</li>
		  <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> HP Laptops, Windows 11. Both at home and at work.</li>
		  <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>WEB250 Database Driven Websites</li>
				<li>DBA285 Data Warehousing & Mining</li>
				<li>DBA125 Database Reporting</li>
				<li>** All of these courses are required for me to complete my degree but I am excited to pull it all together in the 2 higher level classes and work on my data 
				visualization skills in DBA 125.</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me By:</strong> The most obvious is my name is Cyle. That’s Kyle with a C. I know, you probably haven’t seen it spelled like that before.</li>
		  <li><strong>I'd Also Like to Share:</strong>  I enjoy spending time outside with my boys riding bikes, fishing, spectating sports and any number of other activities that keep us off the screens.</li>
