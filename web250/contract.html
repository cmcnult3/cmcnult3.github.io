		<h1 style="text-align: center;" > Contract</h1>
		<p>I, Cyle E. McNulty agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2023, WEB250, Database Driven Websites with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, 
		or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
		I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and 
		never from my classmates.</p>
		<p>Signed: Cyle E. McNulty , 01/15/2023 </p>
